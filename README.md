## üöÄ How to Run MigrantMatcher

To launch the application, simply run the `Main.java` class and follow the instructions displayed in the terminal.

### Running the test script: `casoDeUsoProcurarAjuda()`

1. The `input.txt` file is already prepared with:
   - 3 help offers
   - 3 help requests

2. When the script is executed, the application will automatically scan the `input.txt` file, which must follow the structured command format below:

#### Expected format for `input.txt`:

##### Use Case: Register Help
```
-volunteer
-999999999              // Volunteer‚Äôs phone number
-(type of help)
-(number of people it hosts OR item description)
-(region)
-yes                    // Confirm donation
-123456                 // Confirmation code
-no                     // End operation
```

##### Use Case: Search for Help
```
-migrant
-(phone number)
-(name)
-(region you‚Äôre moving to)
-(type of sorting: type or date)
-0                      // Select help
-no                     // Don‚Äôt add more help
-yes                    // Confirm reservation
-no                     // End operation
```

3. The result of the script execution will be written to the `output.txt` file.
